# 2DAdventureGame

##Due to issues, compatibility and time restraint, This project is now Abandoned!

## Project Overview

In this tutorial, we will begin a completely new project; specifically, a 2D adventure game in which the player controls an alien character, exploring and navigating a dangerous world complete with quests and interactive elements.

In this project we will cover the following topics:

- **2D characters and player movement**
- **Assembling complex and multipart characters**
- **Level design**
- **2D Physics and collision detection**


The assets for this project can be found under the *Project Companion Files* module in the *2D Adventure Game* folder on Ayrshire College MyLearning.

Adventure games require the player to use their cunning, dexterity, mental sharpness, and acumen to make progress. Such games feature dangerous obstacles, challenging missions, and character interaction, as opposed to **all-out** action like many first-person shooter games. Our adventure game will be no exception. 

In this game, the player moves around using the keyboard arrows or **W, A, S, D** keys. Furthermore, they can jump with the spacebar and interact with characters simply by approaching them. During the game, the player will be tasked with a mission from an NPC character to collect an ancient gem hidden somewhere within a level. The player must then navigate dangerous obstacles in search of the gem, and then finally collect it before returning to the NPC, completing the game.
